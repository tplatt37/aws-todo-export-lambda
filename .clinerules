# TypeScript Project Guidelines

## Build and Lint Requirements
- Always run `npm run lint` before making code changes to ensure code quality
- Always run `npm run build` after making changes to verify the project compiles successfully
- If creating CloudFormation YAML or JSON run `cfn-lint filename.yaml` to check for correctness
- Run both commands whenever working with TypeScript files (.ts, .tsx)
- If lint errors are found, fix them before proceeding
- If build fails, resolve compilation errors before continuing

## Development Workflow
- Lint → Edit → Build → Test cycle for all TypeScript changes
- Use `npm run lint -- --fix` to auto-fix linting issues when possible
